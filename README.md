# JP Morgan Quant Challenge - SiliconLobby [Arkadeep & Hiten]
36-hour competition that exposed participants to machine learning, derivative modelling, and how to apply their knowledge to the real-life problems faced by the Quantitative Research and Data Analytics teams on a day to day basis.
## Question 1 -  Flight Price Predictor
### Predictive Modelling with Machine Learning
Optimal timing for airline ticket purchasing from the consumerâ€™s perspective is challenging principally because buyers have insufficient information for reasoning about future price movements. In this challenge we simulate various models for computing the best possible expected future prices by constructing new features from the existing features and also introducing new features to make our model more robust.

## Question 2 - Stock Price Simulation
### Monte Carlo Simulation
Simulate Stock Price Movement using historical data

## Question 3 - Derivative Price Evaluation
### Probablity Theory and Monte Carlo Simulation
Given Payoff States and Contingency Claims evaluate the fair price of the derivative designed
